# InspiringDots

The InspiringApps logo has lost its dots. I aim to build a web-based tool to help
us restore them.

# Project Plan

Get the coordinates of the empty spaces in the maze (after styling). Once the dots are being dropped it'll check to see if the dot is being dropped on a coordinate of the empty circles. If it is being dropped in a spot where there is an empty circle it'll fill the empty spot. If it's being dropped at a coordinate that isn't specified, it'll go back to it's original starting position.

## HTML5 & CSS3

- Creating a canvas div that will contain all of the elements.
- Simple reset of margins & padding
- Utilize Drag & Drop API that HTML5 provides for simplicity sake.
